# Asturiosity - 3D Printed Rover üöÄ

The **Asturiosity** project focuses on developing a 3D-printed exploration rover at the scale of the Perseverance rover. This project allows both advancements in the knowledge of robotic systems within the university community, as well as the dissemination and creation of educational activities related to space exploration.

## Features

- **3D Printed Rover**: The rover is primarily built using 3D-printed components, making it accessible and customizable for anyone interested in building their own exploration robot.
- **Arduino Mega 2650**: The rover is powered by an Arduino Mega 2650 microcontroller, providing ample capacity for controlling sensors and actuators.
- **Remote Control**: Equipped with a **FlySky FS-i6X 10ch + RX ia6b** remote control system for wireless navigation.
- **Power Supply**: Uses **3S batteries** to provide the necessary energy to the rover's motors and electronic components.
- **Educational Outreach**: The project includes educational activities for schools, where students can learn about robotics and space exploration through hands-on experience.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Mega 2650** microcontroller
- **FlySky FS-i6X 10ch** remote controller and **RX ia6b** receiver
- **3S batteries** for powering the rover
- 3D-printed components (files and instructions available in the repository)
- Motors, sensors, and other electronics as detailed in the project documentation

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** or any compatible platform for programming the Arduino Mega 2650
- Required libraries:
  - `Servo.h`: For controlling the rover's motors
  - Additional libraries based on the sensors and actuators used in the project

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MediaLabUniovi/Asturiosity.git
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
